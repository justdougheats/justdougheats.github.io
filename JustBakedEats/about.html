            Hi! I'm Arlene, baking is my hobby and creating is my fuel. I am a 19-year old student at UC Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology. Sometimes, I like to hang up my lab coat to put on an apron and when I do, I use this website and its related instagram to share my baked goods. If you are a cookie, cake, or pastry enthusiast like me, then this is the right place to be! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I will be based in Indonesia for the next few months due to the pandemic but all my ingredients are outsourced from the United States. I strive for quality ingredients and believe baked delicacies should be a guilt-free pleasure! (when consumed moderately) I am passionate about nutrition & what happens under the microscope, but I also like to look away to check what’s baking in my oven because everyone deserves a treat!
